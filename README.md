# Xcode and Make

This example is inspired by Stack Overflow question: [Xcode Build Phase Input Folder](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36425619/xcode-build-phase-input-folder) and suggests to use Make for the purpose of incremental compilation of a subproject instead of using Xcode's Run Script Input/Output Files columns.
